NAME
----
git-diagnose - Generate a zip archive of diagnostic information

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git diagnose' [(-o | --output-directory) <path>] [(-s | --suffix) <format>]
	       [-a | --all]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Collects detailed information about the user's machine, Git client, and
repository state and packages that information into a zip archive. The
generated archive can then, for example, be shared with the Git mailing list to
help debug an issue or serve as a reference for independent debugging.

The following information is captured in the archive:

  * 'git version --build-options'
  * The path to the repository root
  * The available disk space on the filesystem
  * The name and size of each packfile, including those in alternate object
    stores
  * The total count of loose objects, as well as counts broken down by
    `.git/objects` subdirectory

This tool differs from linkgit:git-bugreport[1] in that it collects much more
detailed information with a greater focus on reporting the size and data shape
of repository contents.

OPTIONS
-------
-o <path>::
--output-directory <path>::
	Place the resulting diagnostics archive in `<path>` instead of the
	current directory.

-s <format>::
--suffix <format>::
	Specify an alternate suffix for the diagnostics archive name, to create
	a file named 'git-diagnostics-<formatted suffix>'. This should take the
	form of a strftime(3) format string; the current local time will be
	used.

-a::
--all::
	Include more complete repository diagnostic information in the archive.
	Specifically, this will add copies of `.git`, `.git/hooks`, `.git/info`,
	`.git/logs`, and `.git/objects/info` directories to the output archive.
	This additional data may be sensitive; a user can reconstruct the full
	contents of the diagnosed repository with this information. Users should
	exercise caution when sharing an archive generated with this option.
